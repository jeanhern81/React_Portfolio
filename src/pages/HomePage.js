        <p>I've played around with code since the late 90s and recently decided I wanted to learn more. I've always loved a nicely crafted webpage; so, I enrolled in UCR Extension Coding Boot Camp where I am learning everything from HTML5 to JavaSript and everything in between.</p>
        <p>
        I am currently enrolled in a web development program through UCRâ€™s Extension. I have a background in social media marketing and content photography. I am also highly experienced in costume jewelry designer and a self-taught leather-smith with strong management skills. I am also skilled in e-Commerce Retail Management, Adobe Photoshop, and Fluent in Spanish with a Bachelor's of Arts focused in Anthropology from the University of North Texas. 
        </p>
        <p>Coding gives me the ability to create and problem solve at the same time. I view my creativity as problem solving. If I want to learn something and have no idea how to do it, I figure out what skills I need and teach myself those basic skills to get me to where I want to be. It's this strong thirst for knowledge that helped me become an accomplished leathersmith. It is the same determination I bring to this new journey as web developer.</p>
